# DiscoNet
This is lab3 in course Networkbased virtual environments (D7038E) at LTU. 

The game consists of three different disks, positive- negative- and player-disks.

The goal is to get as many points as possible. A player can get points by bumping into positive disks, but get negative points by hitting negative disks.
